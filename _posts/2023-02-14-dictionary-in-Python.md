### Introduction

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs. A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values.

```python
dict = {
  "Venezuela": "Caracas",
  "Argentina": "Buenos Aires",
  "Chile": "Santiego"
}
print(dict)
```
